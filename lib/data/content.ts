    question: "What's included in the monthly retainer?",
    answer:
      "Your monthly retainer covers all 11 AI engines, dedicated sending domains, daily monitoring and optimization, bi-weekly strategy calls, automated reporting, 24/7 client portal access, Slack/Telegram support, and CRM integration. The only additional cost is the per-meeting performance bonus.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the per-meeting bonus work?',
    answer:
      "You only pay the meeting bonus when we deliver a qualified meeting—defined as a live conversation with a decision-maker who matches your ICP and has buying authority. We verify each meeting before invoicing. This performance-based model means our incentives are fully aligned with yours.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
    answer:
      "We accept ACH bank transfers (preferred), credit cards (3% processing fee), and wire transfers for international clients. Standard payment terms are Net 15, with a 2% discount available for payment within 7 days.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I pause my campaign?',
    answer:
      "Yes, you can pause for up to 30 days. During a pause, your retainer is reduced by 50% while we maintain your domains and configurations. This is helpful for holidays or temporary capacity constraints.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my reply rate is below the guarantee threshold?",
    answer:
      "If your reply rate stays below 3% for 30 consecutive days, you can exit with 15 days written notice and receive a pro-rated refund of your unused retainer. We work proactively to prevent this—The Judge engine detects issues early and The Scientist continuously optimizes your campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between tiers?",
    answer:
      "The main differences are sending capacity (domains and monthly emails), support frequency (bi-weekly vs. weekly vs. dedicated CSM), and per-meeting bonus rates. All tiers include access to all 11 AI engines and the same core features. Founding Partners get lifetime locked pricing at our lowest rates.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a long-term contract?',
    answer:
      "After your 90-day pilot period, you're on a month-to-month basis with 30 days written notice to cancel. No long-term lock-in. We earn your business every month through results.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can I get started?',
    answer:
      "Our standard onboarding is 14 days from signed agreement to campaign launch. This includes domain provisioning, warmup initiation, CRM integration, and campaign development. First replies typically come within 48-72 hours of launch.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What outreach channels do you support?',
    answer:
      "Currently, we specialize in AI-powered cold email—it's our core strength and where we deliver the best results. LinkedIn outreach is on our product roadmap. We believe in transparency: we focus on doing email exceptionally well rather than spreading thin across multiple channels.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure email deliverability?',
    answer:
      "Every client gets dedicated sending domains (no shared IPs). We handle SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configuration, run a 14-day warmup process, and continuously monitor domain reputation. Our Guardian engine checks for blacklists every 4 hours and alerts us immediately if any issues arise.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What compliance standards do you follow?',
    answer:
      "We're GDPR and CAN-SPAM compliant. Every email includes one-click unsubscribe, opt-outs are processed within 24 hours, and we check DNC lists before every send. We also follow Gmail and Yahoo's 2024-2025 sender requirements to maintain optimal deliverability.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I try before committing long-term?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Every engagement starts with a 90-day pilot at full capacity. After the pilot, you're on month-to-month with 30-day notice to cancel. No long-term contracts required—we earn your business every month through results.",
